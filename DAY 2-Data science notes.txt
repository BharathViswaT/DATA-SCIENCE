KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
	It shows how will a company or a project or process are performing

DATA CLEANING
	Handling missing values and incorrect values

EDA (Exploratory Data analysis)
	trend-Peak or Fall (Short period of Time)
	Seasonality- Continuation of the trend(Long period of time)
analyzing the deviation, changes and updations is Eda
Datapoint-Collected Data(single data)
Building the machine and analysing the performance

Legends-Representing different data's with different colours or symbols to make identification Easy

steps involved in model building


workflow
problem definition 
Identifying the problem before starting the project

data collection 
collecting datas for creating a solution

preprocessing 
cleaning the unstructured data using techniques from eda like cleaning

feature engineering

model selection
Selecting which algorithm is used to solve the problem

training 
Using the data collected to  train the ml for identifying the solution 

evaluation 
The training result is evaluated to check whether the answer is right or not

deployment 
implementing the ml in real time and gets value from real tim

monitoring
